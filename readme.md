## ‚ùì how it works
Voilib performs 4 main tasks: **collecting**, **transcribing**,
**indexing** and **querying** podcasts episodes to find the most
interesting fragments for every user prompt.

- **collection**: Almost all public podcasts have an associated `RSS
  feed` that contains **metadata** about every episode and a link to
  the **audio file**. Voilib uses those feeds to **collect and store**
  that metadata from the list of podcasts configured by the
  application admin. Additionally, Voilib can also index your own
  audio files.

- **transcription**: The collected episodes are then transcribed using
  [Whisper: Open AI's Open Source Transcription
  Model](https://openai.com/research/whisper).

- **index**: Episodes transcripts are divided into **fragments of
  approximately 40 words** (check `DEFAULT_FRAGMENT_WORDS` constant to
  see the value currently used). Then, Voilib calculates the
  [embedding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sentence_embedding) of
  each fragment. In that way, every fragment is converted into a
  vector of 384 floating point numbers (check `EMBEDDINGS_SIZE`
  constant to see the embedding size currently used). Those vectors
  are stored in a [vector database: Qdrant](https://qdrant.tech/).

- **queries**: For each new user prompt, Voilib just needs to
  calculate the embedding of it and find the closest ones in the
  vector database, returning the most relevant episodes fragments to
  the user.
