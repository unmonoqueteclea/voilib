# üéß Voilib Deployment
This folder contains all the infrastructure code needed to run
**Voilib**.  It uses some Docker-based services configured with a
`Docker Compose` file (that is different in development and in
production).

> The main commands to build and run all the needed services are in
> the provided [makefile](./makefile). Run `make` from [infra/
> folder](./) to see all of them (although you should read all this
> guide first).

## in development mode...
In development mode (see [development/ folder](./development))
frontend and backend code is using a [bind
mount](https://docs.docker.com/storage/bind-mounts/) so that you don't
need to rebuild the Docker images every time you change something in
the code.

- The [compose.yml](./development/compose.yml) file expects a
`.env.dev` file in the [./development/](./development) folder with the
needed environment variables.  **You should create it before building
any service**, you can copy the provided
[.env.dev.example](./development/.env.dev.example).

‚ñ∂Ô∏è When the `.env.dev` file is created, you can build the Docker images
for all the services with `make dev-build` (it performs a `docker
compose build`) and run all of them with `make dev-run` (it performs a
`docker compose up`). The following services will be available:

- Application **frontend** at [http://localhost](http://localhost)
  (although it won't be ready yet for queries)
- **Management Dashboard** at [http://localhost:8501](http://localhost:8501)
  (although it won't be ready yet for queries)
- **REST API** at
  [http://localhost/service/](http://localhost/service/) with
  `Swagger` docs at
  [http://localhost/service/docs](http://localhost/service/docs)
- `Traefik` dashboard at
  [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080). Traefik is used as a
  **reverse proxy server**.
- `Qdrant` (vector database) running at
  [http://qdrant:6333](http://qdrant:6333) (from the internal Docker
  network)


‚ÑπÔ∏è Now read [first-run tasks section](#first-run-tasks) to find how to
 configure and start adding content to the application.

## in production...
- As in development (read [that section](#in-development-mode) first),
**you must create a `.env.prod` file** in the
[./production/](./production) folder from the provided example:
[.env.prod.example](./production/.env.prod.example)


- When you do it, ensure to use your own domain in `VITE_API_HOST`.
Replace it also in the following lines from the `compose.yml` file
(you can search and replace `voilib.com` in the file):

```yaml
- "traefik.http.routers.ui.rule=(Host(`voilib.com`) && PathPrefix(`/`))"
```

 ```yaml
 - "traefik.http.routers.api.rule=(Host(`voilib.com`) && PathPrefix(`/service`))"
 ```

 ...and


```yaml
- "traefik.http.routers.management.rule=(Host(`voilib.com`) && PathPrefix(`/management`))"
```

-  There are also some references to `voilib.com` in
 [traefik.prod.toml](./production/traefik.prod.toml) that you should
 replace with your own domain.

-  You should change the default `SECRET_KEY` provided in
 [.env.prod.example](./production/.env.prod.example) by running the
 suggested command, and also the `ADMIN_PASSWORD`.

‚ñ∂Ô∏è To build all the production images and run them, use `make prod-build`
and `make prod-run`.

‚ÑπÔ∏è Now read [first-run tasks section](#first-run-tasks) to find how to
 configure and start adding content to the application.

## first run tasks
The first time you run all the services you will need to perform the
following tasks.

###  üíæ running database migrations

> ‚ÑπÔ∏è In Docker-based installations, Voilib will run migrations
> automatically from a Docker entrypoint. You can skip this step.

Voilib uses `sqlite` to store some information about podcasts and
episodes. To ensure the database file with all the needed tables is
created you should run the following command from [infra/ folder](./):

```bash
cd development && docker compose --env-file=.env.dev exec backend alembic upgrade head
```

...or this one in production:

```bash
cd production && docker compose --env-file=.env.prod exec backend alembic upgrade head
```


###  üë§ creating and admin user

> ‚ÑπÔ∏è In Docker-based installations, Voilib will create automatically
> the admin user. By default, username will be `voilib-admin` and
> password `*audio*search*engine`, although they can be configured
> with environment variables. So, you can skip this step.


Open `Swagger` at
[http://localhost/service/docs](http://localhost/service/docs) (or in
your own domain name if you are running in production mode) and use
the `/users/signup` endpoint to register a new user. You can use
whatever email or password you want but, to ensure the user is
automatically recognized as an admin, you should use the username
**`voilib-admin`**.

> ‚ÑπÔ∏è There is a setting with the name `admin_username` to tell
> `FastAPI` the username we want to be automatically promoted to admin
> after sign-up.

There are some API endpoints that can be only used by admin users. You
can check all the available endpoint with `Swagger`.

###  üéß adding podcasts metadata

> ‚ÑπÔ∏è This can be also done from **Voilib Management Dashboard**.
> From there, you can also add your own audio files to Voilib.

The file [urls.json](../backend/src/voilib/collection/urls.json)
contains the list of podcast that Voilib will collect. By default it
contains the ones offered at [voilib.com](https://voilib.com). You can
change this list and add the feeds from all the podcasts you want. I
usually use [listennotes.com](https://www.listennotes.com) to find the
URLs of the RSS feeds of my favorite podcasts.

The following command (run it from from [infra/ folder](./)) will
start collecting episodes from all the configured feeds:

```bash
cd development && docker compose --env-file=.env.dev exec worker voilib-episodes --update
```

...or this one in production:


```bash
cd production && docker compose --env-file=.env.prod exec worker voilib-episodes --update
```

### üïí configuring periodic collect/transcript/index jobs

> ‚ÑπÔ∏è You can easily run these tasks from  **Voilib Management Dashboard**.

You can use `cron` to configure **periodic jobs** that will
**collect**, **transcript** and **index** new episodes. Here you have
my development configuration (assuming you work in Linux, run `crontab
-e` to modify `cron` configuration):

```bash
# update list of episodes every 6 hours
0 */6 * * * cd /{change-me}/voilib/infra/development && docker compose --env-file=.env.dev exec worker voilib-episodes --update

# transcribe last day episodes every 12 hours
20 */12 * * * cd /{change-me}/accushoot/voilib/infra/development && docker compose --env-file=.env.dev exec worker voilib-episodes --transcribe-days 1

# index pending episodes every 6 hours
40 */6 * * * cd /{change-me}/voilib/infra/development && docker compose --env-file=.env.dev exec worker voilib-episodes --store

```

...and my production configuration


```bash
# update list of episodes every 6 hours
0 */6 * * * cd /{change-me}/voilib/infra/production && docker compose --env-file=.env.prod exec worker voilib-episodes --update

# transcribe last day episodes every 12 hours
20 */12 * * * cd /{change-me}/accushoot/voilib/infra/production && docker compose --env-file=.env.prod exec worker voilib-episodes --transcribe-days 1

# index pending episodes every 6 hours
40 */6 * * * cd /{change-me}/voilib/infra/production && docker compose --env-file=.env.prod exec worker voilib-episodes --store
```

Don't forget to change all `/{change-me}` to the actual path that
contains the Voilib repository.
